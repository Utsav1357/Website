He completed his plus-two, which is the eleventh and twelfth standard, with science as the major subject. He also aspired to do MBA.

        <h5 class="head-5">Where was Paras born ?</h5>
        <p>Paras was borm in 24th of october 1987 A.D in kathmandu, Nepal.Kathmandu is the capital city of nepal. Kathmandu is and has been for many years the centre of Nepal's history, art,     culture, and economy. It has a multiethnic population within a Hindu and Buddhist majority. It is also the home of the Newars. Religious and cultural festivities form a major         part of the lives of people residing in Kathmandu.Paras says that, this place is very close to my heart as for the first time my I lifted a bat was in this place.
            There are a lot of memory I have created here in this place. My childhood when there was no bat with me and only thing I had was wooden stick to hit the ball and that was so fun.
            In kathmandu we use to go to different places everyday. I remeber having a motorcycle and trying to take the motorcycle up to hill. So, we were 4 friends and we wanted to take our motorcycle up to the hill but we couldn't rather than  we felt so bad I broke my arm at that time. All these memories are very immportant to me. I never wanted to be a cricketer. In fact being a sportsperson was never in my career option. I used to play all kinds of sports when I was a kid and i pretty much played football, basketball, table tennis, athletics through my school and college. But as I started playing cricket starting from under 15, then under 17 and under 19 followed by the senior team, I felt that it was something I was always meant to do. </p>

But as I started playing cricket starting from under 15, then under 17 and under 19 followed by the senior team, I felt that it was something I was always meant to do. In this society it is very diffcult for us to choose your passion as an sport. People try to convince their parents to go to sport. In this case I think I was lucky because I was very good at studies so convincing my parents was not an issue. They never asked me to stop playing. I feel blessed in a way that they always supported me to make my choices. The only thing they have said is that I need to complete my studies as well, which I did. I completed my Bachelors. But right now so many things are happening that I don’t have time for everything. </p>

            <p class = "para">There is no enough opportunity for young people to grow. Every year we have so many graduates in different fields. Where is employment for all the graduates? We                     have such a small market.

                                Currently, the overall percentage of Younger generation is around 60% and since we have such a small market, there is a lack of opportunities due to which people are going abroad.

                                Talking about cricket, I think we have opened different dimension. We need to find right people to move it forward in cricket. I am sure people will invest. Just think Without investment we have come to this level, if there will be investment then!!! And yes It will be helpful for country’s economic development too. What if we have two big cricket stadiums? We can always host. May be we can have international tournament in Nepal whether Nepal plays or not. May be between India and Pakistan! Many people will come. It will help for economic growth of the country too. The culture and environment in terms of cricketing aspect is great here. Cricket has given opportunity that we can dream big. I always say you should dream big whatever field you are.

                                You should think big at least you will end up somewhere. You should have honesty and continuous devotion, Success will not come over night. It will take time. For some it might take whole life. But at the end, it is about being satisfied and being passionate of what you are doing.</p>

            <p class="para">More than in my life, I have seen huge changes in the cricket scenario of Nepal. Before people hardly knew about cricket and the team but now-a-days, people everywhere wave at us when they see us.

            I think everybody is glad that Nepal was a part of the cricket World Cup. We can see changes in the attitude of the people about Cricketers and sportsmen. I think people have realized Sports also can play significant role in the country. Because one sport united an entire nation, what more you can ask for?

            But of course, there is still a lot to be done in this field in the country. I still need to make lots of contribution. Because of cricket “hami chininchau, ma chininchu “. Let’s hope I can continue and do my best to promote cricket in every way I can. My dream is to see Nepal winning the cricket world cup soon. So, probably I am going to make a huge amount of effort on this side to make the players united and play fro theri country and that is my coming goal.</p>
